# Spotify x Melon

## What is and why this project? 
  I love music, but it is difficult to find a great, updated collection of Korean music in Spotify.

  Instead of paying for Melon (South Korean Spotify) or going to Melon's top charts daily and manually creating/editing playlists, I created this CLI app to do it for me (or for someone else who configures it).

  This app idea was a great idea to implement more intermediate level Python concepts, get more experience with projects and their separated components, and learn more about REST APIs!

   Hopefully you'll enjoy it. You can get a full list of playlists that are fully automatically created using this exact program at my Spotify profile...

## What should I know before using? 
  I've removed sensitive information, primarily information from info/spotify_data/spotify-client.json and info/spotify_data/spotify-tokens.json as those pertain to access to the Spotify API.

  To run this app, you will only have to go to Spotify's app development website and put in information like...

		spotify-client.json
		{
		  'client_secret': ...,
		  'client_id':...,
		}

  Then you can do python manage.py -h, run the authentication setup, and follow the instructions and it will all set up for you! 

  Then all that is left is to set up the playlists and manage them (e.g. refresh). 
  
## There are some issues, what should I do? 
  Let me know or make your own pull request! I'm always open to feedback on my code, the features, and anything else.

  Just contact me and I'll get back to you!
